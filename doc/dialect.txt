==============================================================================

Dialect is a simple plugin that persists the words added with zG and zW to
a spellfile specific to the current directory.


Usage                                                          *dialect-usage*
-----

    - Keep using zg and zw the way you always did.

    - The words you add with zG and zW will be added to
      "./.dialect.{encoding}.add".

    - By default, dialect.vim uses a 'spellfile' for each directory. If you
      want a different 'spellfile' for each specific file, add this to your
      .vimrc:
>
        let g:dialectmode = 'file'
<
