==============================================================================

Dialect is a simple plugin that persists the words added with zG and zW to
a spellfile specific to the current directory.


Usage                                                          *dialect-usage*
-----

    - Install Dialect using your favorite plugin manager or copy dialect.vim
      to "~/.vim/plugin".

    - Keep using zg and zw the way you always did.

    - The words you add with zG and zW will be added to |g:dialectfile|.


g:dialectfile                                                  *g:dialectfile*
-------------

This is the file where dialect saves words added with zG and zW.

The default value is: >

    .dialect.{encoding}.add
>
(As with 'spellfile', if you don't specify a path, the current directory is
used.)
